# MERRA-2 GLOBAL DUST AND ITS IMPLICATIONS
 
## Aidin Raphael Abramowitz

## Introduction

Through aggregating calculations, calculating anomalies, composites, comparison and scatter plots, and temporal correlation coefficient calculations, I am to try to understand the physical movement and transport of dust on a global scale. 
In general, the aim to to describe the influence of dust on a global scale during a selected year, and visualise certain regions throughout the globe that are uniquely prone to anomalies, correlations, etc.


## Data

From the year of 2015:
The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) , NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE
Spatial Grid: 2D, single-level, full horizontal resolution

Data includes 115 different data variables

AND 

North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Climate Index from [NOAA](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/) that has monthly data from 1948-2023.
