# MERRA-2 DUST VARIABLES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS
 
## Aidin Raphael Abramowitz

## Introduction

Through aggregating calculations, calculating anomalies, composites, comparison plots, regressions and/or temporal correlation coefficient calculations. I am to try to understand the physical movement and transport of dust on a global scale. 
In general, the aim to to describe the influence of dust on a global scale during a selected year, and visualise certain regions throughout the globe that are uniquely prone to anomalies, correlations, etc.
