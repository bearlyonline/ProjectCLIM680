# MERRA-2 GLOBAL DUST AND ITS IMPLICATIONS
 
## Aidin Raphael Abramowitz

## Introduction

I am applying MERRA-2 Global Data to a variety of different dust related variables to determine unique phenomena.
In general, the aim to to describe the influence of dust on a global scale during a selected year, and visualise certain regions throughout the globe that are uniquely prone to anomalies, correlations, and other interpretations.

## Data

From the year of 2015:
The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) , NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE
Spatial Grid: 2D, single-level, full horizontal resolution
Dimensions: longitude=576, latitude=361, time=24, Global 
Data includes 115 different data variables

AND 

North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Climate Index from [NOAA](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/) that has monthly data from 1948-2023.

## Code Description

Based on my own graduate research, the day of August 25th, 2015 is of specific interest. While my own research is focused on a much smaller region, I was curious to know the level of submicron dust globally on that day.
